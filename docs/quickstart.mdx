# Quickstart Guide

Get your DeepMirror bot up and running in three simple steps.

## Step 1: Launch the Bot

Open the DeepMirror bot in Telegram:

<Card title="Launch DeepMirror Bot" icon="telegram" href="https://t.me/deepmirror_bot">
  Open @deepmirror_bot in Telegram
</Card>

Tap `/start` to initialize your account.

## Step 2: Authenticate with zkLogin

DeepMirror uses Sui's zkLogin for secure, passwordless authentication:

1. Tap **🔐 Wallet** from the main menu
2. Select **Sign in with Google**
3. Complete the OAuth flow in your browser
4. Return to Telegram - your wallet is ready!

<Note>
  zkLogin creates a Sui wallet tied to your Google account. No seed phrases to remember!
</Note>

Your wallet address will be displayed in the chat. Save it for depositing funds.

## Step 3: Fund Your Wallet

Send testnet tokens to your wallet address:

- **SUI** - For gas fees (minimum 0.5 SUI recommended)
- **DEEP** - For DeepBook trading fees (minimum 10 DEEP)

## Step 4: Add a Maker to Copy

Now you're ready to set up copy trading!

### Find a Maker Wallet

Choose a wallet address you want to copy. You can:
- Use a known profitable trader's address
- Find makers on DeepBook V3 analytics
- Test with your own maker wallet

### Configure Copy Trading

1. Tap **📊 Copy Trading** from the main menu
2. Select **Add Maker**
3. Enter the maker's wallet address
4. Choose your position sizing strategy:
   - **Fixed ratio** - Copy at a specific percentage (e.g., 10%)
   - **Fixed amount** - Use same SUI amount every time
   - **Match maker** - Copy their exact position size

5. Tap **Activate** to start monitoring

<Tip>
  Start with a **10% ratio** for your first position to limit risk while you learn.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Monitor Your Positions

Once active, the bot monitors your maker 24/7:

1. When the maker places an order on DeepBook V3, you receive a notification
2. Your copy position is automatically created at your configured ratio
3. You get a confirmation message with position details

View all positions anytime with `/positions` command.

## What Happens Next?

Your bot is now actively monitoring! Here's what to expect:

### When Maker Places an Order

1. **Detection** - Bot detects maker's new position within milliseconds
2. **Calculation** - Computes your position size based on your ratio
3. **Execution** - Places your order on DeepBook V3
4. **Notification** - Sends you a Telegram message with details
5. **Tracking** - Monitors position status and order count

### Position Lifecycle

Your copy positions will:
- **Monitor** - Track maker's active orders
- **Execute** - Place orders when maker does
- **Update** - Sync order counts in real-time
- **Notify** - Alert you of any changes

## Example Workflow

Here's a complete example:

```
1. Maker opens position: SUI/DBUSDC pool
2. You receive notification: "🎯 New maker position detected!"
3. Your ratio: 10%
4. Maker's position: 100 SUI
5. Your position: 10 SUI (automatically calculated)
6. Bot places order on DeepBook V3
7. You receive confirmation with transaction hash
```
