# Wallet Management

DeepMirror uses **zkLogin** to create a self-custodial Sui wallet tied to your Google account. No seed phrases, no private keys to manage—just sign in and trade.

## Understanding zkLogin

zkLogin is Sui's innovative authentication system that combines:

- **OAuth 2.0** - Familiar Google sign-in flow
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** - Cryptographic security without exposing credentials
- **Blockchain addresses** - Deterministic wallet generation from your Google account

### How It Works

1. You sign in with Google
2. zkLogin generates a zero-knowledge proof of your OAuth token
3. A unique Sui address is derived from your Google account ID
4. The bot stores your ephemeral key pair (valid for 7 days)
5. Transactions are signed using the ephemeral key + ZK proof

<Info>
  Your wallet address is **deterministic** - signing in with the same Google
  account always gives you the same address.
</Info>

## Access Your Wallet

From the main menu, tap **🔐 Wallet** or use the `/wallet` command.

### Wallet Information

The wallet screen shows:

- **Wallet Address** - Your Sui blockchain address
- **SUI Balance** - Available SUI for gas fees
- **DEEP Balance** - DEEP tokens for trading fees
- **zkLogin Status** - Authentication state (Active/Expired)

## Sign In with zkLogin

### First-Time Setup

1. Tap **🔐 Wallet** from main menu
2. Select **Sign in with Google**
3. Click the authentication link sent by the bot
4. Complete Google OAuth in your browser:
   - Choose your Google account
   - Grant permissions
   - Copy the redirect URL
5. Paste the redirect URL back in Telegram
6. Your wallet is created!

<Tip>
  The OAuth flow opens in your default browser. Make sure you have access to
  copy the final redirect URL!
</Tip>

### Session Management

zkLogin sessions expire after **7 days** for security. When expired:

- You'll see "❌ zkLogin not active" in wallet screen
- Simply sign in again with the same Google account
- Your wallet address remains unchanged
- All positions and settings persist

## Check Your Balance

The wallet screen displays real-time balances:

```
💼 Your Wallet

Address: 0x1a2b3c4d5e6f...
SUI Balance: 2.45 SUI
DEEP Balance: 150.00 DEEP

zkLogin: ✅ Active (expires in 5 days)
```

### Required Balances

For copy trading, you need:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

</Card>

## Refresh Balance

Balances update automatically when you open the wallet screen. To manually refresh:

1. Go to **🔐 Wallet**
2. Tap **↻ Refresh Balance**
3. Wait 2-3 seconds for on-chain query

## Export Your Wallet (Advanced)

Want full control? You can export your wallet to use in other Sui wallets like Sui Wallet or Suiet.

<Warning>
  Exporting your private key is an **advanced feature**. Store it securely -
  anyone with this key controls your funds!
</Warning>

### How to Export

1. Go to **🔐 Wallet**
2. Tap **🔑 Export Wallet**
3. Confirm the security warning
4. Receive your wallet details:
   - **Address** - Your public Sui address
   - **Private Key** - Your secret key (keep safe!)
   - **Google Account** - Linked OAuth account

5. Import into any Sui wallet using the private key

### After Exporting

You can now:

- Use your wallet in Sui Wallet browser extension
- Access it via command-line tools
- Backup your private key in a password manager
- Continue using zkLogin in the bot (works independently)

<Note>
  Even after exporting, zkLogin continues to work. The bot maintains its own
  ephemeral keys separate from your exported private key.
</Note>

## Security Best Practices

### DO ✅

- Keep your Google account secure with 2FA
- Monitor your balance regularly
- Sign out when not actively trading
- Export and backup your wallet if holding significant value
- Verify transaction details before confirming

### DON'T ❌

- Share your zkLogin redirect URLs with anyone
- Use a shared Google account
- Store large amounts on testnet (it's for testing!)
- Ignore session expiration warnings
- Trust unsolicited messages asking for wallet access

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="zkLogin session expired">
    **Solution:** Sign in with Google again. Your wallet address stays the same, and all positions remain active.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Balance shows 0 but I sent tokens">
  **Solution:** 1. Verify the transaction on [Sui
  Explorer](https://testnet.suivision.xyz/) 2. Confirm you sent to the correct
  address 3. Wait 30 seconds and refresh balance 4. Check you're on testnet (not
  mainnet)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="OAuth redirect not working">
  **Solution:** 1. Make sure you're using a browser (not in-app Telegram
  browser) 2. Copy the **entire** redirect URL including `#` 3. Paste back in
  Telegram within 5 minutes 4. If expired, start sign-in process again
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't find my wallet address">
  **Solution:** 1. Go to `/wallet` command 2. Your address is displayed at the
  top 3. Tap to copy to clipboard 4. Starts with `0x...` (66 characters)
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wallet address changed">
    **Solution:** Wallet addresses are deterministic. If it changed, you likely:
    - Used a different Google account
    - Cleared bot data (use `/start` to restore)
    - Contact support if neither applies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Gas and Fee Management

### Gas Fees (SUI)

Every blockchain transaction requires gas:

| Operation         | Typical Cost  |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Placing an order  | 0.01-0.03 SUI |
| Creating position | 0.02-0.05 SUI |
| Canceling order   | 0.01-0.02 SUI |
| Capability grant  | 0.03-0.05 SUI |

<Tip>
  Keep at least **2 SUI** in your wallet for smooth operation. The bot will warn
  you when balance is low.
</Tip>

### Trading Fees (DEEP)

DeepBook V3 charges fees for order placement:

- With DEEP: **0.02%** (discounted)
- With base tokens: **0.03%** (standard)

DeepMirror **always uses DEEP** for lower fees.

Example:

- Position size: 10 SUI
- Fee: 10 × 0.0002 = 0.002 SUI worth of DEEP
- Approximately: 0.02-0.05 DEEP tokens

## Balance Alerts

DeepMirror sends automatic notifications when:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Low SUI" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Below 0.1 SUI**
    
    Transaction failures likely. Refill immediately.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Low DEEP" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Below 5 DEEP**
    
    Not enough for trading fees. Get more DEEP.
  </Card>
