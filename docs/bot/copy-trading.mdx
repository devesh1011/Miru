# Copy Trading Guide

Miru's copy trading system monitors maker wallets 24/7 and automatically replicates their DeepBook V3 positions in real-time.

## How Copy Trading Works

When you add a maker wallet, Miru:

1. **Monitors** their transactions on Sui blockchain
2. **Detects** when they place orders on DeepBook V3
3. **Calculates** your position size based on your ratio
4. **Executes** your copy trade within milliseconds
5. **Notifies** you via Telegram with position details
6. **Tracks** the position lifecycle and order status

<Info>
  All copy trades execute **on-chain** through DeepBook V3. No centralized
  intermediaries, full transparency.
</Info>

## Access Copy Trading

From the main menu, tap **📊 Copy Trading** or use `/copy` command.

## Add a Maker Wallet

### Step 1: Find a Maker

You need the Sui address of the trader you want to copy. You can:

- Track profitable wallets from DeepBook analytics
- Follow community-recommended traders
- Use your own test wallet for learning

<Warning>
  Only copy traders you trust! Miru executes trades automatically. Do your own
  research.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Add the Maker

1. Tap **📊 Copy Trading**
2. Select **➕ Add Maker**
3. Enter the maker's Sui wallet address:
   ```
   0x1a2b3c4d5e6f7890...
   ```
4. Confirm the address

The maker is now added but **inactive** by default.

### Step 3: Configure Position Sizing

Before activating, configure how you'll size your positions:

1. Select your newly added maker
2. Tap **⚙️ Configure**
3. Choose a sizing strategy:

#### Strategy 1: Fixed Ratio (Recommended)

Copy at a fixed percentage of the maker's position size.

**Example:**

- Maker opens: 100 SUI position
- Your ratio: 10%
- Your position: 10 SUI

Best for: Consistent risk management, easy to understand.

```
Ratio options: 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%
Custom: Enter any percentage (1-100%)
```

#### Strategy 2: Fixed Amount

Use the same SUI amount regardless of maker's position size.

**Example:**

- Maker opens: 50 SUI position → You open: 5 SUI
- Maker opens: 200 SUI position → You open: 5 SUI (same)

Best for: Capital preservation, limiting exposure.

```
Amount range: 0.1 - 1000 SUI
```

#### Strategy 3: Match Maker

Copy the maker's exact position size.

**Example:**

- Maker opens: 75 SUI → You open: 75 SUI

Best for: High-conviction copying, when you have similar capital.

<Warning>
  **Match Maker** can use significant capital if the maker opens large
  positions. Use with caution!
</Warning>

### Step 4: Activate Copying

1. Review your configuration:
   - Maker address
   - Position sizing strategy
   - Current balances (SUI + DEEP)

2. Tap **✅ Activate**
3. Confirm the activation

The maker is now **actively monitored**. You'll receive notifications when they trade.

## Position Sizing Examples

### Example 1: Conservative (10% Ratio)

```
Maker Position A: 50 SUI  → You: 5 SUI
Maker Position B: 100 SUI → You: 10 SUI
Maker Position C: 20 SUI  → You: 2 SUI

Total maker: 170 SUI
Total you: 17 SUI (10% of maker's total)
```

### Example 2: Fixed Amount (5 SUI)

```
Maker Position A: 30 SUI  → You: 5 SUI
Maker Position B: 150 SUI → You: 5 SUI
Maker Position C: 80 SUI  → You: 5 SUI

Total maker: 260 SUI
Total you: 15 SUI (fixed exposure)
```

### Example 3: Aggressive (50% Ratio)

```
Maker Position A: 40 SUI → You: 20 SUI
Maker Position B: 60 SUI → You: 30 SUI
Maker Position C: 100 SUI → You: 50 SUI

Total maker: 200 SUI
Total you: 100 SUI (50% of maker's total)
```

## Manage Multiple Makers

You can copy up to **10 makers simultaneously**. Each maker has independent settings.

### View All Makers

The **Copy Trading** menu shows:

- Maker address (truncated)
- Status (Active ✅ / Inactive ❌)
- Current configuration
- Number of active positions

### Edit Maker Settings

1. Select a maker from the list
2. Tap **⚙️ Configure**
3. Change ratio or strategy
4. Save changes

<Note>
  Configuration changes only affect **new positions**. Existing positions remain
  unchanged.
</Note>

### Pause Copying

To temporarily stop copying a maker:

1. Select the maker
2. Tap **⏸️ Pause**
3. Confirm

Paused makers:

- Stop creating new positions
- Keep existing positions active
- Can be resumed anytime

### Remove a Maker

To permanently delete a maker:

1. Select the maker
2. Tap **🗑️ Remove Maker**
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Removing a maker does **not** close existing positions. Manage those
  separately via `/positions`.
</Warning>

## Capabilities and Permissions

For the bot to execute copy trades, you need to grant it a **Capability object**.

### What is a Capability?

Capabilities are on-chain permission objects that allow the bot to:

- Access your balance manager
- Place orders on your behalf
- Interact with DeepBook V3

**You retain full control:**

- Capabilities are revocable
- Limited to specific actions
- Don't give access to withdraw funds

### Grant Capability

The first time you activate a maker, you'll be prompted:

1. Review the capability details:

   ```
   Granting access to:
   - Place orders on DeepBook V3
   - Use your balance manager
   - Execute copy trades

   NOT granted:
   - Withdraw tokens
   - Transfer assets
   - Access other protocols
   ```

2. Tap **Approve Transaction**
3. A transaction link appears
4. Open in browser and approve via zkLogin
5. Capability is created!

<Tip>
  You only grant capability **once**. It works for all future copy trades.
</Tip>

### Revoke Capability

To remove bot's permissions:

1. Go to **🔐 Wallet**
2. Tap **🔒 Manage Capabilities**
3. Select capability to revoke
4. Confirm revocation
5. Approve transaction

After revoking, the bot can no longer place trades until you grant a new capability.

## Notifications

## Copy Trading Lifecycle

Here's what happens from start to finish:

### 1. Maker Places Order

Maker wallet submits a transaction to DeepBook V3:

- Creates a new position
- Places limit orders
- Sets price and quantity

### 2. Bot Detects Transaction

Miru monitors blockchain events:

- Detects maker's transaction within 500ms
- Extracts position details (pool, side, price)
- Validates it's a DeepBook V3 trade

### 3. Position Creation

Bot creates your copy position:

- Calculates size based on your ratio
- Checks your balances (SUI + DEEP)
- Creates position record in database
- Sends you a notification

### 4. Order Execution

Your order is placed on DeepBook V3:

- Uses your capability object
- Matches maker's pool and side
- Adjusts quantity per your ratio
- Pays fees with DEEP tokens

### 5. Position Monitoring

Miru tracks both positions:

- Syncs order counts
- Monitors maker's updates
- Alerts you of changes
- Provides `/positions` view

### 6. Position Lifecycle

Positions remain active until:

- You manually close via `/positions`
- Maker closes their position
- You deactivate the maker
- Balance insufficient for new orders

## Advanced Configuration

### Smart Filters (Coming Soon)

Filter which positions to copy based on:

- Minimum/maximum position size
- Specific trading pairs only
- Time-based rules (e.g., only during Asian hours)
- Risk limits (max positions per day)

### Auto-Close Settings (Coming Soon)

Automatically close positions when:

- Maker closes their position
- Target profit/loss reached
- Time limit exceeded
- Certain market conditions met

### Position Limits (Coming Soon)

Set boundaries to protect capital:

- Max positions per maker
- Max total exposure across all makers
- Daily loss limits
- Reserve balance (never trade below X SUI)

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

- **Start small** - Use 5-10% ratio while learning
- **Monitor balances** - Keep sufficient SUI and DEEP
- **Research makers** - Only copy trusted, proven traders
- **Set limits** - Don't over-leverage even on good makers
- **Check positions daily** - Via `/positions` command
- **Diversify** - Copy multiple makers to spread risk

### DON'T ❌

- **Blindly copy** - Always understand the maker's strategy
- **Max leverage immediately** - Don't start with 100% ratio
- **Ignore notifications** - Stay informed of all trades
- **Copy too many makers** - Quality over quantity
- **Forget to refill** - Low balances = missed opportunities
- **Panic close** - Let your strategy play out

## Risk Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much capital should I allocate?">
    **Conservative:** 5-10% of total capital per maker
    **Moderate:** 10-25% per maker
    **Aggressive:** 25-50% per maker
    
    Never allocate more than you can afford to lose. Start conservative.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many makers should I copy?">
  **Beginners:** 1-2 makers to learn mechanics **Intermediate:** 3-5 makers to
  diversify **Advanced:** 5-10 makers with different strategies More isn't
  always better. Focus on quality.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if maker makes bad trades?">
  Your positions are **independent**. If maker's strategy fails: 1. Pause the
  maker immediately 2. Close your positions via `/positions` 3. Remove the maker
  4. Capital loss is limited to positions already opened
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I lose more than my position size?">
    **No.** On DeepBook:
    - Positions are fully collateralized
    - No margin trading or leverage (beyond 1x)
    - Maximum loss = position size
    - No liquidations or negative balance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Maker traded but I didn't copy">
    **Possible causes:**
    1. Maker is paused/inactive (check status)
    2. Insufficient SUI for gas
    3. Insufficient DEEP for fees
    4. Capability revoked (re-grant)
    5. Bot detecting wrong transaction type
    
    **Solution:** Check balances, verify maker is active, review notifications for error message.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Position size incorrect">
  **Causes:** - Configuration updated after position created - Rounding errors
  on small amounts - Balance too low to match exact ratio **Solution:** Verify
  configuration in maker settings. Newest config applies to future positions
  only.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't activate maker">
  **Requirements:** - zkLogin active (not expired) - Capability granted -
  Minimum balance (0.5 SUI + 10 DEEP) **Solution:** Check wallet screen, refresh
  zkLogin, grant capability.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too many positions created">
    **Cause:** Maker is very active trader
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Use smaller ratio (5% instead of 25%)
    2. Pause maker temporarily
    3. Set filters (when available)
    4. Close oldest positions manually
