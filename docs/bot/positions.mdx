- 8 BID orders
- 4 ASK orders
Average per day: 4 orders
```

This helps you understand:

- Maker's trading frequency
- Your capital deployment rate
- Fee accumulation

```
Total Across All Positions: 67 SUI

By Maker:
- Maker A: 35 SUI (52%)
- Maker B: 20 SUI (30%)
- Maker C: 12 SUI (18%)
```

### Time-Based Stats

View position age and activity:

- **Oldest position** - 7 days active
- **Newest position** - 2 hours active
- **Most active** - 45 orders in 3 days
- **Least active** - 0 orders (monitoring)

## Position Limits

### Maximum Active Positions

- **Per maker:** Unlimited
- **Per user:** 50 positions
- **Recommended:** 5-10 active positions

<Tip>More positions = more complexity. Focus on quality over quantity!</Tip>

### Why Limit Positions?

Managing too many positions can lead to:

- Difficulty tracking performance
- High gas fee accumulation
- Capital spread too thin
- Notification overload

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Position shows 0 orders but maker is active">
    **Causes:**
    - Bot just created position, maker hasn't placed order yet
    - Maker placed order but it failed
    - Detection lag (usually < 1 second)
    
    **Solution:** Wait a few seconds and refresh. If persists, check maker's address is correct.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Order count not updating">
  **Causes:** - Maker hasn't placed new orders - Network delay in fetching
  DeepBook data - Position is inactive/paused **Solution:** Tap refresh icon.
  Check maker's recent transactions on Explorer.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't close position">
    **Causes:**
    - zkLogin session expired
    - Insufficient SUI for cancellation gas
    - Network connectivity issue
    
    **Solution:** Re-authenticate zkLogin, ensure > 0.1 SUI balance, retry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Position stuck in monitoring">
    **Possible reasons:**
    - Maker created position but hasn't placed orders
    - Maker position is on different pool
    - Bot missed initial order (rare)
    
    **Solution:** Verify maker's pool address matches. Check maker's transactions. Contact support if issue persists.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Daily Routine

1. **Check positions** - Open `/positions` once per day
2. **Review notifications** - Read all position updates
3. **Monitor balances** - Ensure adequate SUI + DEEP
4. **Assess performance** - Are positions profitable?
5. **Adjust strategy** - Close underperformers, add to winners

### Weekly Review

1. **Position audit** - Close old/inactive positions
2. **Maker evaluation** - Are they still performing?
3. **Capital rebalancing** - Adjust position sizes
4. **Fee analysis** - Are gas costs reasonable?
5. **Strategy refinement** - What worked, what didn't?

### Red Flags

Close or pause positions if:

- ❌ Maker stops trading for 3+ days
- ❌ Multiple failed orders in a row
- ❌ Position losing money consistently
- ❌ Maker's strategy changed dramatically
- ❌ Unusual order patterns
