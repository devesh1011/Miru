# Fee Structure

Understanding all costs associated with copy trading on DeepMirror.

## Overview

Copy trading on DeepMirror involves two types of fees:

| Fee Type         | Paid To           | Paid With           | Purpose              |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Gas Fees**     | Sui validators    | SUI                 | Execute transactions |
| **Trading Fees** | DeepBook protocol | DEEP or quote token | Order placement      |

<Info>
  Both fees are **unavoidable** on blockchain. DeepMirror doesn't charge any
  additional platform fees!
</Info>

## Gas Fees (SUI)

Gas fees compensate Sui validators for processing your transactions.

### What is Gas?

Every blockchain transaction requires **computational resources**:

- CPU cycles to execute
- Storage to record state
- Network bandwidth to propagate

Validators charge **gas fees** to cover these costs.

### Gas Calculation

```
Gas Fee = Gas Units × Gas Price

Gas Units: Computation required (varies by transaction)
Gas Price: Market rate (typically 1,000 MIST per unit)
```

**1 SUI = 1,000,000,000 MIST**

### Typical Gas Costs

| Operation           | Gas Units     | Cost (SUI) |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Place limit order   | 10,000-30,000 | 0.01-0.03  |
| Create position     | 20,000-50,000 | 0.02-0.05  |
| Cancel order        | 10,000-20,000 | 0.01-0.02  |
| Grant capability    | 30,000-50,000 | 0.03-0.05  |
| zkLogin transaction | 40,000-80,000 | 0.04-0.08  |

<Note>
  Actual costs vary based on network congestion and transaction complexity.
</Note>

### Example: Opening a Position

```
Operation: Copy maker's SUI/DBUSDC position

Steps:
1. Create position record (0.02 SUI)
2. Place first limit order (0.03 SUI)

Total Gas: ~0.05 SUI
≈ $0.05 at $1/SUI
```

### Gas Budget

DeepMirror sets a **gas budget** for each transaction:

```typescript
const tx = new Transaction();
tx.setGasBudget(50_000_000); // 0.05 SUI max
```

**If transaction needs more:**

- Transaction fails
- Used gas is **still charged**
- Position not created

**If transaction needs less:**

- Only actual gas charged
- Remainder returned

### Monthly Gas Estimates

For active copy traders:

| Activity Level | Operations/Month          | Gas Cost (SUI) |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Light**      | 10 positions, 50 orders   | 2-3 SUI        |
| **Moderate**   | 30 positions, 150 orders  | 6-9 SUI        |
| **Heavy**      | 100 positions, 500 orders | 20-30 SUI      |

<Tip>
  Keep at least **5 SUI** in your wallet for smooth operation. The bot will warn
  at 0.5 SUI.
</Tip>

## Trading Fees (DEEP)

DeepBook charges fees when your orders execute.

### Fee Structure

DeepBook V3 offers **discounted fees** when paying with DEEP tokens:

| Payment Method        | Fee Rate      | Example (10 SUI @ 1 DBUSDC) |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| **DEEP tokens**       | 0.02% (2 bps) | 0.002 DBUSDC worth of DEEP  |
| **Base/Quote tokens** | 0.03% (3 bps) | 0.003 DBUSDC                |

**Savings with DEEP:**

```
Standard fee: 0.003 DBUSDC
DEEP fee: 0.002 DBUSDC
Savings: 33% lower fees!
```

### How DEEP Fees Work

When you place an order:

1. **Order value calculated:**

   ```
   10 SUI @ 0.95 DBUSDC = 9.5 DBUSDC
   ```

2. **Fee computed:**

   ```
   9.5 × 0.0002 = 0.0019 DBUSDC worth of fees
   ```

3. **DEEP equivalent calculated:**

   ```
   DEEP/DBUSDC rate: 0.10
   DEEP needed: 0.0019 / 0.10 = 0.019 DEEP
   ```

4. **DEEP deducted from balance manager:**
   ```
   Before: 100 DEEP
   After: 99.981 DEEP
   ```

### Fee On Execution, Not Placement

**Important:** Fees charge only when orders **fill**, not when placed.

```
Place order: 10 SUI @ 0.95 (no fee yet)
↓
Order sits in book for 2 hours
↓
Order fills: 10 SUI bought (fee charged now)
```

**Implications:**

- Canceled orders = no fee
- Partially filled = fee on filled portion only
- Immediate fill = fee right away

### Fee Examples

#### Example 1: Small Position

```
Position: 5 SUI @ 1.00 DBUSDC
Value: 5 DBUSDC

With DEEP:
Fee: 5 × 0.0002 = 0.001 DBUSDC ≈ 0.01 DEEP

With Base Token:
Fee: 5 × 0.0003 = 0.0015 DBUSDC
```

**Savings:** 0.0005 DBUSDC per order

#### Example 2: Large Position

```
Position: 100 SUI @ 0.95 DBUSDC
Value: 95 DBUSDC

With DEEP:
Fee: 95 × 0.0002 = 0.019 DBUSDC ≈ 0.19 DEEP

With Base Token:
Fee: 95 × 0.0003 = 0.0285 DBUSDC
```

**Savings:** 0.0095 DBUSDC per order

#### Example 3: High-Frequency Copying

```
Scenario: Maker places 10 orders/day
Average size: 20 SUI @ 1.00 DBUSDC

Daily fees:
10 orders × 20 SUI × 1.00 × 0.0002 = 0.04 DBUSDC ≈ 0.4 DEEP

Monthly (30 days):
0.4 × 30 = 12 DEEP (~$1.20)

Annual:
12 × 12 = 144 DEEP (~$14.40)
```

<Warning>
  High-frequency copying can accumulate significant fees. Monitor your DEEP
  balance!
</Warning>

### DEEP Balance Requirements

Recommended DEEP holdings:

| Copy Activity   | DEEP Balance | Lasts For        |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| **Testing**     | 10 DEEP      | ~25 small orders |
| **Light Use**   | 50 DEEP      | ~125 orders      |
| **Regular Use** | 100 DEEP     | ~250 orders      |
| **Heavy Use**   | 500+ DEEP    | ~1,250+ orders   |

<Tip>
  Refill DEEP before it drops below **10 tokens**. The bot alerts at 5 DEEP.
</Tip>

## Total Cost Breakdown

### Per Position Lifecycle

```
Create Position:
└─ Gas: 0.02-0.05 SUI

Place Orders (5 orders average):
├─ Gas per order: 0.01-0.03 SUI
├─ Total gas: 0.05-0.15 SUI
└─ Trading fees: 0.05-0.10 DEEP (when filled)

Cancel/Close (if needed):
└─ Gas: 0.01-0.02 SUI per order

TOTAL PER POSITION:
Gas: 0.08-0.22 SUI (~$0.08-$0.22)
Trading Fees: 0.05-0.10 DEEP (~$0.05-$0.10)
```

### Monthly Estimates

For a moderate user (3 makers, 10% ratio):

```
Assumptions:
- 20 new positions/month
- 5 orders per position average
- 50% of orders fill

Gas Costs:
20 × 0.05 SUI (create) = 1 SUI
100 × 0.02 SUI (place) = 2 SUI
Total: ~3 SUI/month

Trading Fees:
50 orders × 0.02 DEEP/order = 1 DEEP/month

TOTAL MONTHLY:
~3 SUI + 1 DEEP
≈ $3.10 USD at $1/SUI, $0.10/DEEP
```

<Info>
  These are **estimates**. Actual costs depend on: position sizes, maker
  activity, network gas prices, and DEEP/SUI rates.
</Info>

## Fee Optimization Strategies

### 1. Use DEEP Tokens

**Always** pay fees with DEEP:

- ✅ 33% lower trading fees
- ✅ Supports DeepBook ecosystem
- ✅ Predictable costs

DeepMirror does this automatically (`payWithDeep: true`).

### 2. Optimal Position Sizing

Larger positions = better fee efficiency:

```
Scenario A: 10 small positions (1 SUI each)
Gas: 10 × 0.05 = 0.5 SUI
Trading fees: 10 × 0.002 = 0.02 DEEP
Total: 0.5 SUI + 0.02 DEEP

Scenario B: 1 large position (10 SUI)
Gas: 1 × 0.05 = 0.05 SUI
Trading fees: 1 × 0.02 = 0.02 DEEP
Total: 0.05 SUI + 0.02 DEEP

Savings: 0.45 SUI (~90% less gas!)
```

**Recommendation:** Use higher ratios (25-50%) instead of many small positions (5-10%).

### 3. Batch Operations

Cancel multiple orders in one transaction:

```
Cancel 5 orders separately:
5 × 0.02 SUI = 0.1 SUI

Cancel 5 orders together:
1 × 0.03 SUI = 0.03 SUI

Savings: 0.07 SUI (70%)
```

<Note>Batch operations coming soon to DeepMirror!</Note>

### 4. Filter Low-Value Positions

Set minimum position size to avoid tiny trades:

```
Without filter:
Maker opens 0.1 SUI position
You copy at 10% = 0.01 SUI
Gas: 0.05 SUI
Fee efficiency: 0.01 / 0.05 = 20% (bad!)

With filter (min 5 SUI):
Position ignored, no fees paid
```

**Coming soon:** Position size filters in settings.

## Fee Transparency

### View Your Fees

Check gas spent:

1. Go to [Sui Explorer](https://testnet.suivision.xyz)
2. Enter your wallet address
3. View transaction history
4. Filter by "Gas Used"
5. Sum total spent

### DEEP Fee Tracking

Monitor DEEP balance over time:

```
Feb 1: 100 DEEP
Feb 7: 87 DEEP
Used: 13 DEEP in 7 days ≈ 1.86 DEEP/day
```

**Future feature:** Built-in fee dashboard showing:

- Total gas spent
- Total DEEP fees
- Fee per position
- Fee trends over time

## Testnet vs. Mainnet Fees

### Testnet (Current)

```
SUI: Free (from faucet)
DEEP: Free (from faucet)
→ No real cost!
```

**Purpose:** Learn and test without financial risk.

### Mainnet (Future)

```
SUI: Real money (~$1.00)
DEEP: Real money (~$0.10)
→ Actual costs!
```

**Estimate for moderate user:**

- Monthly: ~$3-5 USD
- Annual: ~$36-60 USD

<Info>
  Mainnet fees are **much cheaper** than Ethereum (10-100x lower) but **more
  expensive** than Solana.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do I pay gas for failed transactions?">
    Sui validators already processed your transaction (even though it failed). They spent resources, so they charge gas regardless of outcome.
    
    **Minimize failures:**
    - Keep sufficient balances
    - Double-check configurations
    - Test on small amounts first
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get refunds on fees?">
  **No.** Gas and trading fees are **non-refundable** once charged. This is
  standard on all blockchains.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if DEEP price spikes?">
  Trading fees are calculated in **quote token** (e.g., DBUSDC) then converted
  to DEEP. If DEEP pumps: - Fewer DEEP tokens needed per fee - Your DEEP balance
  lasts longer - Effective cost stays same in USD terms
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why not use base tokens for fees?">
  Paying with base/quote tokens costs **50% more** (0.03% vs 0.02%). Over time,
  this adds up significantly. Example over 1 year: - DEEP fees: $14.40 - Base
  token fees: $21.60 - Waste: $7.20 extra
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do cancelled orders cost fees?">
    **Gas: Yes** (0.01-0.02 SUI to cancel)
    **Trading fees: No** (only charged on execution)
    
    Limit your cancellations to save gas!
