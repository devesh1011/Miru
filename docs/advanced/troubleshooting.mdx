    1. Go to `/wallet`
    2. Tap **Sign in with Google**
    3. Complete OAuth flow
    4. Session renewed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify success">
    Check wallet shows:
    ```
    zkLogin: ✅ Active (expires in 7 days)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Set a reminder to renew sessions every 6 days to avoid expiration mid-trade.
</Tip>

### "OAuth redirect not working"

**Symptoms:**

- Paste redirect URL but bot says invalid
- "JWT parsing failed" error
- Authentication stuck

**Common causes:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using in-app Telegram browser">
    **Problem:** Telegram's in-app browser doesn't copy full URL.
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Long-press the auth link
    2. Select **Open in external browser**
    3. Complete OAuth in Safari/Chrome
    4. Copy **entire URL** including `#` fragment
    5. Paste in Telegram
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Incomplete URL copied">
  **Problem:** URL is truncated, missing JWT after `#`. **Solution:** Full URL
  looks like: ``` https://authflow.sui.io/#id_token=eyJhbGc...&state=... ```
  Must include **everything** after `#`. If browser hides it: 1. Click address
  bar 2. Select all (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A) 3. Copy (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C) 4. Paste in
  Telegram
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Waited too long">
  **Problem:** Redirect URLs expire in 5 minutes. **Solution:** 1. Start zkLogin
  process again 2. Complete OAuth quickly 3. Copy/paste within 5 minutes
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong Google account">
    **Problem:** Multiple Google accounts, selected different one.
    
    **Solution:**
    - Use the **same Google account** every time
    - Create dedicated account for Miru
    - Check which account you're selecting in OAuth screen
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### "Wallet address changed"

**Symptoms:**

- Different address than before
- Positions missing
- Balance shows zero

**Cause:** Used different Google account or configuration.

**Solution:**

1. **Verify Google account:**
   - Which account did you use for zkLogin?
   - Sign in with the **original account**

2. **Check on Explorer:**

   ```
   https://testnet.suivision.xyz/account/YOUR_OLD_ADDRESS
   ```

   - Funds still there?
   - Positions still on-chain?

3. **Recover original wallet:**
   - Sign in with original Google account
   - Wallet address should reappear
   - If not, contact support with both addresses

<Warning>
  zkLogin addresses are **deterministic**. Same Google account always gives same
  address. If it changed, you used a different account.
</Warning>

## Copy Trading Issues

### "Maker traded but I didn't copy"

**Symptoms:**

- Maker has new position on DeepBook
- Your bot didn't create copy position
- No notification received

**Diagnostics:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check maker status">
    ```
    /copy
    ```
    Is maker:
    - ✅ Activated (not paused)?
    - ✅ Configured with ratio?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify balances">
    ```
    /wallet
    ```
    Do you have:
    - ✅ SUI > 0.5?
    - ✅ DEEP > 5?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check capability">
    ```
    /wallet > Manage Capabilities
    ```
    - ✅ Capability exists and active?
    - ✅ Not recently revoked?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm pool">
    Did maker trade on:
    - ✅ DeepBook V3? (not V2 or other DEX)
    - ✅ Supported pool? (SUI/DBUSDC, DEEP/SUI, etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Solutions by cause:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Insufficient balance">
    **Error:** "Insufficient SUI balance" or "Insufficient DEEP balance"
    
    **Fix:**
    1. Go to testnet faucets
    2. Get more SUI and DEEP
    3. Verify balance updated with `/wallet`
    4. Next maker trade will copy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Capability missing">
    **Error:** "No active capability"
    
    **Fix:**
    1. `/wallet` > **Manage Capabilities**
    2. Tap **Grant Capability**
    3. Approve transaction
    4. Verify capability created
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="zkLogin expired">
    **Error:** "zkLogin session expired"
    
    **Fix:**
    1. `/wallet` > **Sign in with Google**
    2. Complete OAuth
    3. Session renewed
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Maker not activated">
  **Error:** Maker shows "⏸️ Paused" or "❌ Inactive" **Fix:** 1. `/copy` 2.
  Select maker 3. Tap **✅ Activate** 4. Confirm activation
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong pool">
    **Cause:** Maker traded on unsupported pool or different DEX
    
    **Fix:**

    - Check maker's transaction on Explorer
    - Ensure it's a `deepbook::place_limit_order` call
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### "Position stuck in Monitoring"

**Symptoms:**

- Position created
- Order count stays at 0
- Status: "Monitoring 🔍"
- Hours have passed

**Explanation:** Position is waiting for maker to place their first order.

**Solutions:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Maker hasn't placed orders yet">
    **This is normal behavior.**
    
    - Maker created position but didn't place orders

    - Can take hours or days
    
    **Action:** Wait or close position if tired of waiting.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Maker already has orders (detection failed)">

    3. Contact support with pool address
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### "Order count not updating"

**Symptoms:**

- Position shows 3 orders
- Maker placed 2 more orders
- Your order count still shows 3

**Cause:** Order count syncs every 30 seconds. May be delayed.

   ```
   /positions > Select position > ↻ Refresh
   ```

2. **Wait 1 minute:**
   - Auto-sync may be in progress
   - Check again in 60 seconds

3. **Verify maker actually placed orders:**
   - Check maker address on [Sui Explorer](https://testnet.suivision.xyz)

    3. Retry close
    
    **Cost to close:** ~0.02-0.05 SUI
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="zkLogin expired">
    **Error:** "zkLogin session expired"

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### "Position shows wrong order count"

**Symptoms:**

- Your position: 5 orders
- But checking DeepBook Explorer: only 3 orders

**Cause:** Database and blockchain out of sync.

**Solution:**

1. **Force refresh:**

   ```
   /positions > Select position > ↻ Refresh
   ```

2. **Manually verify on Explorer:**

   ```
   https://testnet.deepbook.tech
   Connect wallet > View positions
   ```

3. **If mismatch persists:**
   - Take screenshots of bot vs Explorer
   - Note position ID
   - Report to support

<Note>

## Wallet Issues

### "Balance shows 0 but I sent tokens"

**Symptoms:**

- Sent SUI/DEEP to wallet address
- `/wallet` still shows 0 balance

**Diagnostics:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify transaction on Explorer">
    1. Go to [Sui Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.suivision.xyz)
    2. Enter your wallet address
    3. Check recent transactions
    4. Confirm tokens arrived
  </Step>

<Step title="Check correct network">
  - Miru uses **Testnet** - Did you send on Mainnet by mistake? - Testnet and
  Mainnet are separate!
</Step>

<Step title="Verify address">
  - Did you copy **entire address**? - Addresses start with `0x` (66 chars
  total) - Check for typos
</Step>

  <Step title="Refresh balance">
    ```
    /wallet > ↻ Refresh Balance
    ```
    Wait 5 seconds for on-chain query.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Solutions:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sent to wrong address">
    **Problem:** Typo or copied wrong address.
    
    **Fix:**
    - Check transaction on Explorer
    - See which address received tokens
    - If it's not yours, tokens are **lost** (testnet, so no big deal)
    - Double-check address next time
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sent on wrong network">
  **Problem:** Sent on Mainnet, bot uses Testnet. **Fix:** - Testnet and Mainnet
  addresses are the same format but separate networks - Tokens sent on Mainnet
  won't appear on Testnet - Use correct faucet for testnet tokens
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction pending">
    **Problem:** Transaction not yet confirmed.
    
    **Fix:**
    - Sui is fast (2-3 seconds usually)
    - If > 1 minute, check Explorer for transaction status
    - May have failed for some reason
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cache issue">
    **Problem:** Bot's cache not updated.
    
    **Fix:**
    1. Tap **↻ Refresh Balance** multiple times
    2. Wait 30 seconds between refreshes
    3. If still wrong, restart Telegram app
    4. Re-check `/wallet`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

   ```
   /wallet > Manage Capabilities
   ```

   Should show active capability

3. **If missing:**
   - Capability grant transaction may have failed

   - [Sui Discord Faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130)
   - Request with `!faucet YOUR_ADDRESS`

3. **Retry transaction**

---

### "Transaction failed: Gas budget exceeded"

**Symptoms:**

- Complex transaction
- "Gas budget exceeded" error
- Some gas still deducted

**Cause:** Transaction needed more gas than budgeted.

**Solution:**

1. **Not your fault** - Bot sets gas budget
2. **Retry** - May succeed on second try (network variance)
3. **If persists** - Report to support with transaction hash

---

### "Transaction failed: Nonce invalid"

**Symptoms:**

- "Invalid nonce" or "Nonce mismatch"
- Transaction rejected

**Cause:** Order nonce out of sync.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network congestion">
  **Delay:** 3-10 seconds - Sui testnet occasionally slow - High transaction
  volume period - Nothing you can do - Usually resolves quickly
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bot overload">
    **Delay:** 10+ seconds
    
    - Many users copying same maker simultaneously
    - Bot processing queue
    - Rare on testnet, possible on mainnet
    - Team monitors and scales
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  **Sub-second execution** is ideal but not always possible. 1-2 second delays
  are normal and acceptable.
</Info>
